## Running Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Kpavan3009/CSCI611_Spring25_PavanSeshaSai_Kasukurti.git
cd CSCI611_Spring25_PavanSeshaSai_Kasukurti/Assignment_2

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

Install required packages
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
pip install opencv-python
pip install pandas

### Step 3: Running the Notebooks
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:Run each cell from it 

2. For Image Filtering:
   - Navigate to `image_filter.ipynb`
   - Run all cells sequentially
   - Check output visualizations

3. For CNN Implementation:
   - Navigate to `build_cnn.ipynb`
   - Run all cells in order
   - Monitor training progress
   - View final results and accuracy

## Results
- Screenshots of execution results are available in the screenshots folder
- Detailed analysis available in the report
